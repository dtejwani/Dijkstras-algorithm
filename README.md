# Dijkstras-algorithm
Aim/Purpose:
The purpose of the assignment is to implement an undirected weighted Graph ADT and performing
Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices. The graph will implement methods
that add and remove vertices, add and remove edges, and calculate the shortest path.


Dijkstra's algorithm computes the length of the shortest path from the source to each of the remaining
vertices in the graph. The algorithm is considered a Greedy algorithm as it uses problem solving
methods based on actions to see if there is a better long-term strategy. Dijkstra’s algorithm uses the
greedy approach to solve the single source shortest problem. It repeatedly selects from the unselected
vertices, vertex v nearest to source s and declares the distance to be the actual shortest distance from s
to v. The edges of v are then checked to see if their destination can be reached by v followed by the
relevant outgoing edges. Dijkstra’s algorithm works by computing the shortest path from source to
vertices among the k closes vertices to the source. It works when it is a directed-weighted graph, and
the edges are non-negative. Modern day applications of the algorithm include traffic information
systems, mapping such as map quest, google maps and routing systems, epidemiology.

Conclusion:
This project helped us learn one of the most important algorithms used in daily life and it showed us
how to work in teams and how to coordinate in a professional environment. We have successfully
implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm to implement an undirected weighted Graph ADT and to find the
shortest path between two vertices. The project has passed all 18 assertions and test cases. This
algorithm can truly be called the greedy algorithm as it chooses the nearest possible vertex known as
local optimum.
